The elegance of a Apple trackpad combined with the power of a Kinesis
keyboard.

## Assembly

Print the holder and two footers models in a Makerbot Replicator 2 at medium
quality & 15% density.

Hot glue the two footers to the keyboard so that they line up with the clickers
on the bottom of the trackpad.

Snap the holder onto the back edge of the keyboard. Finally, snap the trackpad
into the holder.

## Thanks

Trackpad holder is borrowed from the [Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic
